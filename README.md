# Multioutput_regression

Multioutput regression considers the regression tasks with more than one output for the prediction. 

In this project, I implemented a baseline for the "Multi-target regression via input space expansion: treating targets as inputs" [1] experiments. Having a baseline for the reference experiment brings more insight into the advantages of using output as an input in the model.
